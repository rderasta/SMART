Scaling Mod: A Retroactive Treatment

DESCRIPTION

This is a set of xEdit scripts that will:
Calculate every NPC "strength" and set it to scale with PC with the proper scaling mult.
There is a re-leveler variant too. (Atm I feel quite satisfied with it's results, but I mostly use it as an utility to run a perk patcher before scaling)
Re-calculate RACE's stats, based on its own AND size. This will mostly give each race a little boost. (MUST have if using re-scaler script)
Uncap encounter zones. (Also must have for re-scaler)


What you can expect from the scaling: (estimation to date)

Small creatures such as rabbits, skeevers, etc. can get mults as low as 0.01
Medium sized creatures such as most humanoids will range widely from 0.5 to 2.0. This is all very relative to each NPC nature.
Large enemies like snow bears, werewolves, trolls, etc. will likely be around the 2.0 and probably above that too.
Extra large creatures such as dragons will most likely be above 5 times PC lvl. And probably way beyond that too, but i set a limit to 6.5.
Bosses like dragon priests, make an exception and will be extremely strong due to the amount of stats assigned to them.

Note: Results may vary since the formula calculates not only size and race, but also weights in each NPC stats (HMS), so in most scenarios you could predict that bandits will likely have mults below 1.0 and bosses (even a bandit boss) will be at least 2.0 or something cool.
